# Todo List (DOM Version)

A simple and interactive **Todo List** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript DOM manipulation**.  
This project was created as a practice exercise to improve my JavaScript skills and understand how to dynamically handle elements on a web page.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks from the list
- Clean and responsive design

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure of the application
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (DOM)** – Handling dynamic content and user interactions

## Project Structure
```
todo-list-dom/
│
├── index.html 
├── style.css 
└── app.js 
```

## Future Improvements
- I will improve my **CSS file** in future to make the design look better.
